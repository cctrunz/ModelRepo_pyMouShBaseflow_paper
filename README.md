# Model repository containing the model simulations for the paper submitted to The Cryosphere (tc-2022-182):
## Trunz, C., Poinar, K., Andrews, L. C., Covington, M. D., Mejia, J., Gulley, J., & Siegel, V. Observed and modeled moulin heads in the Pâkitsoq region of Greenland suggest subglacial channel network effects, submitted to The Cryosphere (2022)

### Figures are produced with the main two codes:
* Plot_corr_Baseflow_paper.ipynb (simulations with modeled input)
* Plot_figures_with_JEME.ipynb (simulations with idealized input)

### This model runs pyMouSh: Moulin Shape (MouSh) model - Python version
* pyMouSh.py
This is a translation of the moulin-physical-model developped by L.C. Andrews and K. Poinar, from Matlab to python.
